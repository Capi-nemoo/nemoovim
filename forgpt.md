### **Project Summary: Nemoovim**

**Main Goal:**
Nemoovim is a custom Neovim distribution specifically designed for Linux users. Its goal is to provide a highly optimized and easy-to-use setup, with a personalized and powerful text editing experience.

**Project Structure:**
The distribution follows a modular structure, splitting the configuration into different categories:
```

  └── lua/
      └── user/
